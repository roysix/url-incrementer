# URL Incrementer

URLI ("yur-lee") lets you increment any part of the URL. For example, if the URL has a "page=1" in it, URLI can get you to "page=2". You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any site that keeps its URLs organized sequentially by numbers or letters or paginated via next prev links. It's a lightweight extension (under 300KB!) and its core functionality doesn't require any special permissions from you.

To start using URLI, just click the extension icon, select the part of the URL you want to increment, and then press the [+] button (or use shortcuts) to start incrementing!

Features:
- Auto Incrementing (Includes Multi-Tab and Pause Support)
- Downloading (Includes Auto Support) [Experimental] (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Next [>] Prev [<]
- Chrome Shortcuts
- Internal Keyboard / Mouse Button Shortcuts (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Many Options

What's New in Version 5.0 (May 31, 2018)
- URLI's biggest update... EVER!
- NEW Look: New extension icons and more intuitive UI icons that match incrementing and decrementing
- NEW Auto Increment function
- NEW Download function (Experimental)
- NEW female extension mascot for Next Prev named URLN ("yur-lin") to celebrate Next Prev being graduated from Experimental to Standard! =)
- MANY options added: Change the extension icon, adjust the button size, get icon feedback when incrementing or other actions, and add Next Prev buttons to Popup UI
- MANY convenience enhancements: Now saves changes you make in Popup UI, automatically brings up the Setup panel if the URL hasn't been setup, and better support for selecting the part of the URL (now includes touch support!)
- IMPROVED Increment Decrement algorithm so the number pre-selected by URLI is more likely to be "correct"
- IMPROVED Next Prev functionality for MUCH better link accuracy
- IMPROVED Internal Shortcuts: Updated KeyboardEvent: "keyCode" to "code" and MouseEvent: "which" to "button" and also now supports modifier keys as shortcuts (e.g. "Shift" can be used by itself now)
- IMPROVED Permissions: Internal Shortcuts, Next Prev, and Download permissions are now modularized and separate so you can grant and enable only the features you want to
- IMPROVED Internal code: better tab instance memory management (now using JavaScript Map instead of array) + minor bugfixes
- NOTE: The options had to be reset due to this major update and the way URLI now modularizes permissions for each feature. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience!
