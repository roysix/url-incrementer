# URL Incrementer

![URL Incrementer](_assets/img/darku/128.png?raw=true "URL Incrementer")

URLI can help you increment URLs. For example, if the URL has a "page=1" in it or if there's a Next [>] link on the page, URLI can get you to "page=2" quickly and conveniently.

*** "URLI's Developer Toolkit" is a special tool I made to help me test URLI, "unlocked" for you! But because this is a developer tool, it's highly experimental, so please do not expect it to work 100% perfectly! Thank you for understanding. 

** Download Incrementing is an optional and experimental feature that is designed to be used with Auto. URLI can use its Auto-Incrementing capabilities to offer you a unique and flexible "Auto Incrementer Downloader" (think a simple "Down them all" that runs automatically)! It's still rough around the edges, and very much still in BETA. Thank you for being patient as this feature continues to be improved!

**** To help protect your privacy, Your Saved URLs are only stored as irreversible cryptographic hashes, Saved Wildcards are stored as potentially decryptable hashes
