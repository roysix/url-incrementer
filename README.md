# URL Increnex

URL "Incre-Nex" (URLI) lets you "Increment" [+] a URL or go to the "Next" [>] URL. For example, if the URL has a "page=1" in it, URLI can get you to "page=2" quickly and conveniently. Use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any site that keeps its URLs organized sequentially by numbers or letters or paginated via next prev links. It has a ton of features, but is a lightweight extension (under 300KB unzipped!) and its core increment functionality doesn't require any special permissions from you.

To start using URLI right away, just click the extension icon, select the part of the URL you want to increment, and then press the [+] button or use shortcuts to start incrementing!

Features:
- Auto Incrementing
- *Downloading [Experimental] (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Next [>] Prev [<]
- Chrome Shortcuts
- Internal Keyboard & Mouse Button Shortcuts (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Many Options (Alphanumeric Incrementing, Selection algorithms, Interval, Leading Zeros... and so much more!)

*Downloading is a brand new experimental and "opt-in" feature that was specifically added to be used with Auto and to help fulfill the need for a "Auto Incrementer Downloader." It is still a little rough around the edges. We ask for your patience as we work hard to get it up to snuff. Thank you very much for understanding!

What's New in Version 5.0 (May 31, 2018)
- URLI's biggest update... EVER!
- New Name: URLI's "full" name was changed from "URL Plus/Incrementer" to "URL Increnex" to give it a unique name. No worries: URLI's core functionality remains the same: incrementing.
- NEW Look: New extension icons and more intuitive, color-coded button icons! (Blue for Increment/Decrement, Green for Next/Prev, Orange for Auto, Red for Clear)
- NEW Auto Increment function: Supports Multiple Tabs and has Pause/Resume functionality, no more manual incrementing!
- NEW Download function [Experimental]: Added to URLI specifically so that with Auto, you can now create an "Auto Incrementer Downloader." If you don't want this feature -- please don't worry, the Downloading function is NEVER loaded and executed unless you actually enable it first in the Options and there is no Shortcut for it to prevent "invasiveness"
- MANY options added: Change the extension icon, adjust the button size, get icon feedback when incrementing or other actions, and add Next Prev buttons to Popup UI
- MANY convenience enhancements: Now saves changes you make in Popup UI, automatically brings up the Setup panel if the URL hasn't been setup, and better support for selecting the part of the URL (now includes touch support!)
- IMPROVED Increment Decrement algorithm to look for common terms first so the number pre-selected by URLI is more likely to be "correct"
- IMPROVED Next Prev functionality for MUCH better link accuracy (better DOM parsing)
- IMPROVED Internal Shortcuts: Updated KeyboardEvent: "keyCode" to "code" and MouseEvent: "which" to "button" and also now supports modifier keys as shortcuts (e.g. "Shift" can be used by itself now)
- IMPROVED Permissions: Internal Shortcuts, Next Prev, and Download permissions are now modularized and separate so you can grant and enable only the features you want to
- IMPROVED Internal code: better tab instance memory management (now using JavaScript Map instead of array) + minor bugfixes
- NOTE: The options had to be reset due to this major update and the way URLI now modularizes permissions for each feature. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience!
