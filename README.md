# URL Incrementer

URLI ("yur-lee") lets you increment any part of the URL. For example, if the URL has "page=1", URLI can get you to "page=2". You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any site that keeps its URLs organized sequentially by numbers or letters or paginated via next prev links. It's a lightweight extension and its core functionality doesn't require any special permissions from you.

To start using it, just click the extension icon, select the part of the URL you want to increment, and then press the [+] button (or use shortcuts) to start incrementing!

Features:
- Auto Incrementing
- Downloading [Experimental] (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Next [>] Prev [<] [Experimental]
- Chrome Shortcuts
- Internal Keyboard / Mouse Button Shortcuts (Requires Extra Permissions)
- Many Options

What's New in Version 4.4 (May 24, 2018)
- URLI's biggest update... ever! URLI is now back to its original name and being a simple and pure Increment and Decrement extension
- New Look: New extension icons and more intuitive UI icons that match incrementing and decrementing
- New Auto Increment function
- New Download function (Experimental)
- MANY options added: Change the extension icon, adjust the button size, get icon feedback when incrementing or other actions, and add Next Prev buttons to Popup UI
- MANY convenience enhancements: Now saves changes you make in Popup UI, automatically brings up the Setup screen if the URL hasn't been setup, and better support for selecting the part of the URL (now includes touch support)
- Permissions Separated/Modularized: Internal Shortcuts, Download, and Next Prev permissions are now separate so you can grant and enable only what you want to 
- Improved Internal Shortcuts: Updated KeyboardEvent: "keyCode" to "code" and MouseEvent: "which" to "button" and also now supports modifier keys as shortcuts (e.g. "Shift" can be used by itself now)
- Internal code changes: better tab instance memory management (now using JavaScript Map instead of array) + minor bugfixes
- Note: The options had to be reset due to this major update and the way URLI now modularizes permissions for each feature. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience!
