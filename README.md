# URL Incrementer

URL Plus lets you "plus" [+] any part of the URL and can also try to find the "next" [>] link. You can use it on gallery or thumbnail websites, forums, or any website that keeps its URLs paginated via links or organized sequentially by numbers or letters.

Set your own keyboard shortcuts and fine-tune many options, including increment interval, alphanumeric/base and custom regular expression support. It's a lightweight extension that is similar to URL Flipper for Firefox and it was developed with care to not require any special permissions from you.

Next [>] Prev [<] functionality is currently very basic and may not work properly on some sites but will be improved in an upcoming release.

(This extension was previously known as "urli, A URL Incrementer")

What's New in Version 3.3 (July 20, 2015)
- Added back internal keyboard and mouse button shortcuts
- Added support for Alphanumeric and Bases (Base 2 Binary thru Base 36 Hexatrigesimal)
- Added support for selection customization including using custom Regular Expressions
- To provide better flexibility, Plus [+], Minus [-], Next [>], and Prev [<] are now each separate shortcut operations and are no longer "shared" together
- Next [>] Prev [<] functionality now only works with quick shortcuts and was removed from UI to avoid confusion with Plus [+] Minus [-] Setup
- Fixed leading zeros issue where it would forget a number originally had a leading zero after Plus [+]'ing it (e.g. 09 -> 10)
- Fixed an issue where it would forget its URL/Pattern when you go back to Setup after navigating away

Note: The options had to be reset to fix and make all the changes in this update. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.
I apologize deeply to anyone who used this extension from 7/1/2015 thru 7/19/2015 (Version 3 thru 3.2). The extension was in a beta state and should have undergone much more testing before being updated.

Special Thanks:
Coolio Wolfus, Adam C., Will, Blue Chan, and everyone for providing valuable feedback/comments in the reviews and support.
