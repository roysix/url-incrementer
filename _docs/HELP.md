## Infinite Scrolling (Scroll Incrementing)
Infinite Scrolling is the next level of incrementing! But because infinite scrolling is more complicated than the tab updating that URLI was built for, I'm working on a new extension called "Infy Scroll" that will have this functionality, so please look out for it soon!

## Auto Incrementing
Just toggle on AUTO to start an auto-incrementing session! You can have it also repeat by just clicking the `repeat` icon in the upper-right. Auto supports pause/resume.

Auto can be used with Multi, Shuffle, and Download (Auto Incrementer Downloader).

## Download Incrementing (Multiple Page Downloading)
You must first enable Download in the Options to see the Download toggle in the UI.
You can also have each page's downloads stored in its own subfolder while incrementing. Just note that the file name and extension will be based on the URL, so make sure that the `Name` and `Ext` columns look right before choosing this option.


## URLI's Toolkit
This is URLI's own special toolkit used for testing and development that has been "unlocked" and made available to you!
It lets you open up to 100 incremented tabs or generate a list of up to 10,000 incremented links at once.
Click the Tool icon to open or close it. The toolkit works with the URL and selection you have selected.

### Crawling URLs
TODO

The toolkit works with both Shuffle Mode on and Multi-Incrementing (it will do a simultaneous multi-increment on the parts selected).

## Multi Incrementing
Multi lets you increment up to 3 parts of the URL individually, simultaneously, or in ranges. You can even increment the same selection in multiple ways (for example, different intervals)!
Select the part as normal and optionally adjust the interval or base, then click the Multi `+++` button near Selection.
Repeat for each additional part, then click Accept.
You'll then see a new set of color-coded Increment Decrement buttons allowing you to increment for just that part.

Note: You can always reset the multi parts by just clicking on the `+++` button after three parts have been selected.

Here are some of the neat things you can do with Multi:

### Multi Selections
This is the most common use for multi. Select the different parts in the URL to increment and you will have a set of + - buttons for each selection.

### Multi Intervals
Select the **same** number multiple times, but change the interval each time before clicking the Multi `+++` button. This will let you have multiple buttons that can increment/decrement the selection by different amounts (e.g. a +1 Button, a +10 Button, and a +100 button)!

### Multi-Simultaneous Incrementing
If you use Multi with AUTO or the Toolkit, by default all the parts will be incremented simultaneously!

### Multi-Range Incrementing
The most complicated multi function allows you to edit the URL and enter ranges for each selection. This performs a "compounded" increment for each part. This also works with AUTO and the Toolkit.

A Multi-Range Increment Example:
Say you want to increment the three 1s in the following URLs in different ranges (2, 3, 4 from left to right).
`https://www.google.com/1/1/1` would be edited to: `https://www.google.com/{1-2}/{1-3}/{1-4}`

This performs a compounded increment, such that it starts from 1/1/1 and ends at 2/3/4, performing 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 total increments:

    1/1/1 1/1/2 1/1/3 1/1/4

    1/2/1 1/2/2 1/2/3 1/2/4

    1/3/1 1/3/2 1/3/3 1/3/4

    2/1/1 2/1/2 2/1/3 2/1/4

    2/2/1 2/2/2 2/2/3 2/2/4

    2/3/1 2/3/2 2/3/3 2/3/4

You can use Multi Incrementing with AUTO and the Toolkit to generate links or open tabs. In these modes, it will either do a multi-simultaneous increment or a multi-range increment (if you edited the URL to have ranges).

## Date Incrementing
Increment dates and times in URLs by changing the `Base` to `Date Time` and providing a date format that is based on the selection!
The "smallest" part of the date you selected will then be incremented.
For example, if you selected a pattern like month/day/year, then day will be incremented by the interval.

Important: Each part of the date needs to be separated by a non date-format character (like a `/` or a `-`, e.g. `2018/01/25`) or the format needs to contain only fixed-width date formats without any separators (e.g. `20180125`).

*The following formats are variable-width and are **not** allowed without separators: `mmmm`, `Mmmm`, `MMMM`, `m`, `d`, `h`, `i`, `s`,`l`.*

### Date Selection / Format Examples

**Valid Examples**

| Selection  | Format     |
| ---------  | ---------- |
| 01/25/2018 | mm/dd/yyyy |
| Jan-2018   | Mmm-yyyy   |
| 18_1_25    | yy_m_dd    |
| 20180125   | yyyymmdd   |
| 12:30:05   | hh:ii:ss   |
| 1-25_12:30 | m-d_hh:ii  |

**Invalid Examples**

| Selection   | Format     | Reason                                                                    |
| ----------  | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /01/25/2018 | mm/dd/yyyy | Selection has an unnecessary leading / and does not match format |
| 01-252018   | mm-ddyyyy  | Mixed usage of separators and non-separators between date parts           |
| 1252018     | mddyyyy    | Uses a non fixed-width date part without separators ("m" instead of "mm") |
| Sept-2018   | Mmm-yyyy   | "Sept" not in supported short month names ("Sep" only is)                 |

### Date Formats
This is a table of all the allowable parts you can use in the format.

| Format | Component   | Presentation | Examples   |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| yyyy   | Year        | 4 Digits     | 2000, 2010 |
| yy     | Year        | 2 Digits     | 00, 10     |
| mm     | Month       | 2 Digits     | 01, 12     |
| m      | Month       | 1-2 Digits   | 1, 12      |
| mmm    | Month       | Short Name Lowercased  | jan, dec |
| Mmm    | Month       | Short Name Capitalized | Jan, Dec |
| MMM    | Month       | Short Name Uppercased  | JAN, DEC |
| mmmm   | Month       | Long Name Lowercased   | january, december |
| Mmmm   | Month       | Long Name Capitalized  | January, December |

| dd     | Day         | 2 Digits     | 01, 31     |
| d      | Day         | 1-2 Digits   | 1, 31      |
| hh     | Hour        | 2 Digits     | 01, 23     |
| h      | Hour        | 1-2 Digits   | 1, 23      |

| l      | Millisecond | 1-3 Digits   | 1, 999     |

* For the `yy` format (2 Digit Year), if the year is less than 70, we assume the 2000s (2000 - 2069). Otherwise, we assume the 1900s (1970-1999).

### Short and Long Month Names

## Error Skipping
This checks if the next URL will return an HTTP error code (like 404) and increments again, skipping it up to 100 times, or until it finds the next good URL. If an error is encountered, the extension icon will flash with the error code (or flash \"RED\" for redirects). Set it to 0 to disable it. Important: This will make a request to the server each time to check the status code, and setting this value too high might cause the server to issue a \"Too Many Requests\" response. A value of 10 or less should be reasonably OK.

You may notice a minor delay (~1 second) when incrementing with error skipping due to the time it takes to wait for a response from a server.

### An Error-Skipping Example
You are on page=1 and increment with error skip set to 10. If the next 3 pages (page=2 thru page=4) don't exist, they'll be skipped and you'll be taken to the next valid page, page=5 automatically. If more than 10 consecutive pages don't exist, URLI will "give up" checking since error skip is set to 10, and take you to page=12. You can then manually increment again to repeat the process.

### Important Note!
You MUST have Enhanced Mode enabled to use Error Skipping in the following situations:
1. On "Browser Error Pages" (e.g. the website didn't implement an error page, so the browser forwarded you to its own error page)
2. When using the Popup or 1-Click Buttons
3. With AUTO

Finally, a few websites may not send an error code and instead "swallow" the error code, returning HTTP Response Code 200 ("OK") while still displaying a customized error page. Error Skipping won't work on these websites.

## Saving URLs
You can save your favorite `URLs` and Increment Decrement settings for each of them (such as selection, interval, and base).
To save a URL, in the Popup, click the `heart <3` icon and click Accept after you're done. After you save a URL, you can jump straight to using shortcuts to increment on every subsequent visit, even after closing your browser.

***Example***: If you save URL `https://www.example.com/page-1`, and chose to increment the `1` then any URL that is exactly like that URL (except for the `1` part) will be recognized.

You can also save `Wildcards` to match multiple URLs. Wildcards are helpful, if for example, you wanted to match just the domain or a small substring of a URL. Wildcards can just be normal text or also be regular expressions.
To save a Wildcard, in the Options under Saved URLs, click the `Add Wildcard...` button, enter the wildcard, adjust the Increment Decrement settings for it, then click Save.

***Example***: Wildcard `example.com/posts/` with an Interval of `42` will match all URLs that contain `example.com/posts/` and increment them by 42 whenever you visit them.

Saving is completely optional ("opt-in").


### Saving URLs vs Saving Wildcards
URLs are saved just like passwords, must match exactly for it to be recognized (except for the part/number you selected to increment).
However, sometimes -- most especially on image boards or when you do searches -- sites will add tags and other parameters to the URL. In these cases, a **Partial URL** will work the best and allow you to match all the variances.
For example, say you save a partial URL `https://www.site.com/posts` with an Increment of say, 42, then both `https://www.site.com/posts/tags=abc&page=0` and `https://www.site.com/posts/tags=xyz&page=0` will both be "recognized" and allow you to increment the page=0 to 42.
So long as any site starts with your partial URL `https://www.site.com/posts`, then whatever follows (e.g. the `/tags=` part) won't matter and it's considered a "match!"

### How Are URLs Saved?
To protect your privacy, URLs are saved just like the industry standard is for saving passwords: as cryptographic hashes.
We use the PBKDF2 algorithm with an HMAC-SHA512, a randomly generated salt, and a high number of iterations.
This is a *one-way* process, meaning it is impossible for anyone to "decrypt" the hashes.
The only way anyone can figure out the URLs is if they used brute-force and checked every single possible URL in existence using the same cryptographic hash function and random salt and then checking if the hashes are equal.
We also actually split the URL into two parts (replacing the selection with a different string) before hashing it, making even automated dictionary attempts to decipher them **extremely difficult!**

Here's a real example of how a saved URL looks:
`{hash: "", salt: **, selectionStart: 72, selectionEnd: -15, interval: 42, base: 10`

When you view your saved URLs in Options, you'll see a small part of the hash (it's really super long) followed by the interval, base, and other formats.

### Where Are The Cryptographic Hashes Saved?
The cryptographic hashes are *only* saved to your local extension storage space on your PC (not in a sync'd cloud storage space).
You can always delete them in the Options > Saved URLs section or by clicking the Reset Options button.
Also, if you uninstall the extension, all your saved data, including the hashes, are automatically deleted.

### How Are Wildcards Saved?
Wildcards are stored as encrypted hashes with a random IV (initialization vector); they're never saved in the "plaintext" form you originally entered them in.
But unlike the cryptographic hashed URLs, wildcard encrypted hashes can be decrypted if someone were to look at URLI's source code and then run the exact decrypt function and key it uses.
In most cases though, providing this one small layer of protection will be sufficient for most people's needs.
The wildcards will never be in clear view on your computer. For example, if someone were to search thru your extension storage space, they would only find encrypted hashes, and would need to put additional time and effort in to decrypting them.

Many extensions do not bother hashing your saved URLs or encrypting wildcards or even discussing this.
URLI really cares about your privacy and data!

## Shuffle URLs
Click the `crossed-arrows` icon to turn this mode on.

Think of this feature like how you would shuffle a deck of cards.
It shuffles the URLs you'll see next.
For example, say you start AUTO at page=1 with a Times of 9; every page from page=2 to page=10 will be shuffled randomly and you will be guaranteed to see each page only once -- just in a random order.

Adjust the `Shuffle Limit` in the Options to set a max upper bound.

We use the [Durstenfeld algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#The_modern_algorithm) to perform the shuffling in an extremely efficient O(n) time.

You can turn on Shuffle in Normal, AUTO, or Toolkit modes.

## Bases and Custom Bases
Bases are the "types" of numbers we can increment. Think of them like different alphabets. URLI can increment all sorts of bases, even your own made-up custom ones. :)

The most common bases are:
- 2 Binary - 0s and 1s! :)
- 8 Octal - Not commonly used anymore 0-7
- 10 Decimal - Our default number system from 0-9
- 16 Hexadecimmal - 0-9 A-F Hex Colors, Hashing, Cryptography
- 32 Hexatrigesimal - The full alphanumeric alphabet from 0-9 and A-Z (After 9, it goes to A, then every letter till Z and back to 0)
- 62
- 64 Base 64 Extremely popular, Hashing, Cryptography

For a good visual showing bases 2-36, please see the [Table of Bases on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_bases).


### Custom Bases
Change the `Base` to `Custom` and define a custom alphabet.
Here are some common alphabets you can copy/paste into the `Alphabet` input:

Base 62
Base 64 (+-)
...
