## Shuffle URLs
Think of this feature like how you would shuffle a deck of cards. It shuffles the URLs you'll see next. For example, say you start AUTO at page=1 with a Times of 9; every page from page=2 to page=10 will be shuffled randomly and you will be guaranteed to see each page only once -- just in a random order. We use the Durstenfeld algorithm to perform the shuffling in O(n) time.
